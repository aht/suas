Introduction
============

SUAS stands for Simple User Authentication & Session.  It is a package for
Google AppEngine that provides:
	* a simple user authentication implementation in Datastore as an
	alternative to Google Accounts
	* cookie-only signed sessions, no memcached/Datastore

Install
=======

Place the suas directory under your app_dir.  I'd put it under app_dir/ext/.
Then, fetch the git submodule (aetycoon):

	$ cd app_dir/ext/suas
	$ git submodule init
	$ git submodule update

Usage
=====

users.py
	* describes the models for User, UserSignup.

session.py
	* provides a session-capable RequestHandler.  Subclass it for
	all your handlers and you can use session as an attribute of
	the handler.

example/handlers.py
	* provides user authentication handlers, you'll need to adapt to your app.
	* serves an example of how to use "session.py".

Extra
=====

"flash_msg"
	set this cookie and it's automatically popped to session.flash_msg in
	the next page
