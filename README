Introduction
============

SUAS stands for Simple User Authentication & Session.  It is a package for
Google AppEngine that provides:
	* a simple user authentication implementation in Datastore as an
	alternative to Google Accounts
	* cookie-only HMAC-SHA256 signed sessions, no memcached/Datastore


Install
=======

Place the suas directory somewhere under your app_dir/ and import it.


Usage
=====

users.py
	* describes the models for User, UserSignup.

session.py
	* provides a session-capable RequestHandler.  Subclass it for
	all your handlers and you can use session as an attribute of
	the handler.

example/handlers.py
	* provides skeletal user authentication handlers: /login, /logout, /signup,
	/confirmsignup, @login_required.  You'll need to adapt to your app.


Extra
=====

"flash_msg"
	set this cookie and it's automatically popped to session.flash_msg in
	the next page
