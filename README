Introduction
============

SUAS stands for Simple User Authentication & Session.  It is a package for
Google AppEngine that provides:
	* a simple user authentication implementation in Datastore as an
	alternative to Google Accounts
	* cookie-only HMAC-SHA256 signed sessions, no memcached/Datastore


Install
=======

Place the ./suas directory somewhere under your app_dir/ and import it.

Generate a new suas.session.SECRET_KEY. This is CRUCIAL!


Usage
=====

users.py
	* describes the models for User, UserSignup.

session.py
	* provides a session-capable RequestHandler.  Subclass it for
	all your handlers and you can use session as an attribute of
	the handler.

auth_handlers.py
	* provides user authentication handlers: /login, /logout, /signup,
	/confirmsignup, @login_required.  You'll need to adapt to your app.

Utility
=======

session.login_required
	a decorator ditto google.appengine.api.users

session.flash_msg
	set this attribute and it's automatically popped to
	session.flash_msg of the next request

Demo
====

The root directory is a fully functional signup/login/logout app.
It is live at http://suas-demo.appspot.com
